# Raven-hyprdots

The raven-hyprdots pattern will set up a hyprland desktop environment courtesy
of prasanthrangan's excellent [hyprdots](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots).

This hyprland setup is beautiful, but unique. For discerning tastes.

```
cd /home/master/
git clone https://github.com/digital-raven/raven
./raven/patterns/raven-hyprdots/update init
```

Upon completion, raven-hyprdots is now properly installed.
