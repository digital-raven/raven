This directory is for generic customizations you'd like to share between your
machines. These are things like custom modules, overlays, packages, and common
home-manager configurations to be easily imported to the users on a host.

If you wish to install new off-the-shelf software for one machine then
you should put that in [host/pkgs.nix](../host/pkgs.nix)
