    # for themeFile. These will be different then the names shown by `kitten theme`
    #
    # If you want to switch themes, then you have a few options.
    #
    # 1. Because home-manager will make your ~/.config/kitty/* files read-only, you will not
    #    be able to use home-manager and switch your theme using `kitten theme <theme>`. If you
    #    want to easily make edits during run-time without invoking home-manager, then you need
    #    to remove kitty from your home-manager profile in this repository. From there, copy
    #    your preferred kitty.conf file to ~/.config/kitty/ and run `kitten theme <theme>`
    #    to switch your theme. Don't forget the quotes in the following command.
    #
    #      kitten theme "<theme as seen in kitten>"
    #
    # 2. Change the themeFile below and re-run home-manager.
    #
    # 3. If you wish to manage your kitty.conf in home-manager but be able to switch themes on
    #    the fly, then comment out the line below and see the instructions in ./kitty.conf
    themeFile = "tokyo_night_storm";
