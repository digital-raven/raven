A small warning.

It is not expected for raven users to modify anything under this directory patterns.
If you make modifications to the files within this directory then you may experience
merge conflicts if you decide to pull updates from the main raven repository.

It's not **that** big of a deal to make changes here, but these are the files that
differentiate between models offered by Raven.

Raven holds power here.
