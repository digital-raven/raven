This directory is in ALPHA.

The goal for this directory is for a user to modify anything under this
directory as they see fit without risk of merge conflicts.

The problem is if Raven doesn't provide at least a starter level of home-management
then using the commandline programs kind of sucks.

So while a user should use this space to modify their personal touches, pulling
changes to this directory from the Master Raven Repository may cause merge
conflicts, and I think it would simply be elegant if I could provide a good starter
home-manager setup and allow my user to have their customizations and not have
them deal with merge conflicts.

So until I finalize a good starter home-management solution so I can leave it
for good, user changes here may have merge conflicts when pulling from the
Master Raven Repository, even though this is the area where they're supposed to
make those changes.

Also multiple users still need to be considered.
