# Raven

This project is a work in progress. The statements made about current
functionality are goals of the project, and anything and everything is
expected to change until a release has been made.

Project structure will continue more regularly after that point.

The Raven repository contains a collection of conversation ending operating
systems for a competant and demanding user.

Raven is a respectful and competant operating system. Raven is offered
as a product with uncompromising value with respect to your time and money.

The operating systems provided are designed to instantly turn any computer
into a reasonbly configured machine for the intended use.

## Usage
Start with raven-minimal. This will familiarize you with the basic
functionality present on all raven patterns. From there you may install
a more fully equipped varient, or perhaps another operating system
entirely?

Raven-minimal is a bit more well-equipped than your average minimal installation.

## LICENSE
This repository is licensed under the GPLv2. I'm not a lawyer. As I, the
author, understand that license, it is designed so that any improvements
you make to my code flow back to me. That's why Linus Torvalds said he
used it. It's clearly good enough to incentivize unity around the Linux
kernel.

So with that is a guideline, if you use and then modify my code, please
submit your improvements as a pull-request against this repository. I may
not accept it, but you may continue to use and distribute your modifications
after that according to the terms of the GPLv2.

Make no mistake; I would be flattered if you used and improved my code.
