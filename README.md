# Raven

In short, Raven is an operating system. It's a product that you can apply to a
block of computing hardware and then use software applications on it.

In long, what's the actual point of caring about an operating system?

An operating system determines what programs you use, and programs are
made by people, and these people are employed by you. The people you employ and
determine who talks to you. You don't like it when someone speaks without
meaning. Wouldn't it be nice to fire those people?

This product is the operating system answer to that question. If your computer
has annoyed you, then the Raven operating system can help you use your computer
with respect.

Raven is part operating system and part guide. It lets you cut through the hype
of various products and hire the teams of people who actually care enough to be
good at their programming jobs. It is a collection tools and a Seal of Approval
of quality providers that simplifies your computer to the lowest possible cost
of using software and feeling respected while you do so.

Raven contains several models; each designed to instantly turn any computer
into a reasonbly configured machine for the intended use, and each can easily
transition to the other during operation without a reboot.

The Raven project allows you to instantly recreate your desktop computing
environment on any new machine starting from only your github account and an
internet connection.

Raven's claims are...
- The target customer is a non-technical user, though competent enough to understand
  what a file-system and storage devices are.
- By no means does Raven claim hyper-optimization, but it should get the job done
  for home office, gaming, and various development tasks.
- This product teaches you how to live without me, even if you're not a technical
  user. All software requires updates, common sense, and respecting the user as
  the God of their system.

Raven teaches you to have that, but you can conveniently reference this repo
for up-to-date guidance if you're a non-technical user.

- This product can be obtained from me in ways that are free-of-charge with my
  blessing. It's GPLV2 licensed. Share it, back it up, modify it, or create a copy
  and sell to your friends yourself. I won't be mad or get in the way. 
- Raven, when used as guided, is more secure and hygenic than the Windows operating
  system and makes using your computer a quiet and direct experience.
- Raven's author is more or less married to this operating system and its
  providers. I personally deploy this product on all my home computers.
